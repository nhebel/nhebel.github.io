Hi! I am a second year PhD student in the [Operations Research and Industrial Engineering](https://www.orie.utexas.edu/) department at the University of Texas at Austin. My research interests include [macro-energy systems](https://www.macroenergysystems.org/), energy and climate policy, and electric resource planning and adequacy. More broadly, I am interested in supporting decision-makers with the aim of combating climate change and enabling sustainable development. The methods I am interested in include optimization, systems analysis, and economic modeling. I am currently supervised by [Dr. Benjamin Leibowicz](https://sites.utexas.edu/leibowicz/team-2/). I spent the summer of 2024 as an intern with the [Electric Power Research Institute](https://www.epri.com/research/programs/118053), developing and refining models for use in research on electricity market design.

Before beginning my PhD, I worked as an Energy Systems Planning Sr. Analyst at [Strategen Consulting](https://www.strategen.com/), where I worked on projects related to [decarbonization](https://ohiorivervalleyinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ORVI-Industrial_Decar_Pathway_Report_Final.pdf), integrated resource planning and utility regulation. I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering from [Villanova University](https://www1.villanova.edu/university/engineering/academic-programs/departments/mechanical.html), and a Masters in [Energy and Earth Resources](https://www.jsg.utexas.edu/eer/) from the University of Texas at Austin. While earning my masters, I spent the summer of 2021 working at [Jupiter Power](https://www.jupiterpower.io/) as a Corporate Strategy Intern, conducting market research and identifying battery deployment trends across different RTOs and ISOs. I also served as the President of the [Longhorn Energy Club](https://www.longhornenergyclub.com/20212022) from 2021-2022. 

When I have spare time, I enjoy traveling, watching Formula 1, being active outdoors, reading, and knitting.
